## Setup

Clone the project & `cd` into it

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:falcon-coder/graphql-tutorial.git
$ cd graphql-tutorial
```

Install the dev dependencies

```bash
$ npm install
```

Install [graphql-yoga](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-yoga) (the GraphQL server)

you can add it to your package.json file:
```json
    "dependencies": {
        "graphql-yoga": "^1.13.1"
    },
```
Or you can install it with npm:

```bash
$ npm i graphql-yoga@1.13.1
```

Copy the boilerplate code into `index.js`

```js
'use strict';
const {GraphQLServer} = require('graphql-yoga');

const typeDefs = `
    type Query {
        hello(name: String): String!
    }
`;

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        hello: (_, {name}) => `Hello ${name || 'World'}`,
    },
};

const server = new GraphQLServer({typeDefs, resolvers});
server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000'));
```

At this point, you should be able to run `npm start` and navigate to <http://localhost:4000> to see the demo server's playground.

## Organize

Let's organize things a little better!

Go ahead and delete the demo `typeDefs` and `resolvers` from `index.js`.

Create a folder called `resolvers` and add an `index.js` to it.

Create another folder called `schema` and add a file named `schema.graphql` to it.

Now we need to import these into our `index.js`.

Your `index.js` should look like this:

```js
'use strict';
const {GraphQLServer} = require('graphql-yoga');
const typeDefs = ['./schema/schema.graphql'];
const resolvers = require('./resolvers');

const server = new GraphQLServer({typeDefs, resolvers});
server.start(() => console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:4000'));
```

Go ahead and start your server with `npm start`. Your server will automatically restart each time we make changes.

## Creating your first Query

We know our clients need `workStationsList` information, so add your first query to `schema.graphql`

```gql
type Query {
    weatherStationsList: [WeatherStation]
}
```

This query will allow our clients to search for weather stations and get an array of results!

We need to define what an WeatherStation is, so add the `WeatherStation` type to your `schema.graphql`

```gql
type WeatherStation {
    id: String
    name: String
    longitude: Float
    latitude: Float
    altitude: Int
    rank: Int
}
```

Note: These fields are determined by the needs of the clients.

Awesome! But how do we actually return data?

## Creating your first Resolver

Add an `weatherStationsList` resolver to `resolvers/index.js`

```js
'use strict';

const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        weatherStationsList: (root, args) => {
            return [];
        },
    },
};

module.exports = resolvers;
```

Open the playground at <http://localhost:4000> and send a query for `WeatherStation`

```gql
{
  weatherStationsList {
    id
    name
    longitude
    latitude
    altitude
    rank
  }
}
```

You'll receive empty data, but at least we have something executing!

## Let's get some Context

Resolvers take in 4 parameters: `root`, `args`, `context`, and `info`.

* `root` the value of the previous execution level
* `args` any field-level arguments
* `context` an object containing any data that should be made available to all resolvers (think logging functions, session information, data sources, etc.)
* `info` an object containing information about the query such as the selection set, the AST of the query, parent info, etc.

## Creating your first Connector

Most GraphQL services follow some sort of `connector` pattern. The idea here is to have a layer on top of a database/backend driver that has GraphQL-specific error handling, logging, batching, and/or caching. We'll touch more on these topics later. For now, let's just think of it as our data source.

You guessed it! The connector will go on the `context`.

Let's create a new folder called `connectors` with an `index.js`

```js
'use strict';

const connectors = {};

module.exports = connectors;
```

In our main `index.js`, let's import that file and update our server:

```js
...
const connectors = require('./connectors');
const context = {connectors};

const server = new GraphQLServer({typeDefs, resolvers, context});
...
```

Let's add a new file, `connectors/WeatherStations.js`

```js
'use strict';

class WeatherStations {}

module.exports = WeatherStations;
```

and import it into `connectors/index.js`

```js
'use strict';
const weatherStations = require('./WeatherStations');

const connectors = {
    weatherStations: new WeatherStations(),
};

module.exports = connectors;
```

In our `WeatherStations` connector, we know we're going to need to make an HTTP request to the Weather API, so let's kill our server to install some dependencies and then start it back up

```json
        "request": "^2.85.0",
        "request-promise": "^4.2.2"
```

Now we can make HTTP calls!

At the top of `connectors/WeatherStations.js`, require our new dependency

```js
const request = require('request-promise');
```

And let's add our first method to the `iTunes` class

```js
async weatherStationsList() {
        const options = {
            uri: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/stations',
            method: 'GET',
            qs: {
                appid: 'weather appid'
            },
            json: true,
        };

        const items = await request(options);
        if (!items) {
            return null;
        }

        return items;
};
```

Now we can go back to `resolvers/index.js` and consume this connector from our `context`

```js
weatherStationsList: (_, args, ctx) => {
    return ctx.connectors.weatherStations.weatherStationsList(args);
}
```

And that's it!

You can open the [playground](http://localhost:4000) again and send a query for `WeatherStations`:

```gql
{
  weatherStationsList {
    id
    name
    longitude
    latitude
    altitude
    rank
  }
}
```

It works! ðŸ˜Ž

## Get Weather Station

Add a new `Query` for `weatherStation`

```gql
weatherStation(station_id: String): WeatherStation
```

Let's add another method to the `WeatherStations` connector

```js
async weatherStation(args) {
    const options = {
        uri: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/stations/' + args.station_id,
        method: 'GET',
        qs: {
            appid: 'weather appid'
        },
        json: true,
    };

    const station = await request(options);
    if (!station) {
        return null;
    }
    return station;
};
```

and add a resolver for the `weatherStation` query

```js
weatherStation: (_, args, ctx) => {
    return ctx.connectors.weatherStations.weatherStation(args);
}
```

Open the [playground](http://localhost:4000) again and send a query for `weatherStation`

```gql
{
  weatherStation(station_id: "your station_id") {
    id
    name
    longitude
    latitude
    altitude
    rank
  }
}
```

But that's more data than our clients need!

## Get Measurements of Weather Station

Add a new `Query` for `measurementsList`

```gql
measurementsList(station_id: String, type: String, limit: Int, from: Float, to: Float) : [Measurement]
```

We need to define what an `Measurement` is, so add the `Measurement` type to your schema.graphql
`Temperature` is also one of the type defined inside Measurement

```gql
type Measurement {
    type: String
    date: String
    station_id: String
    temp : Temp
}

type Temp {
    max: Float
    min: Float
    average: Float
    weight: Int
}
```

Let's add another method to the `WeatherStations` connector

```js
async measurementsList(args) {
    const options = {
        uri: 'http://api.openweathermap.org/data/3.0/measurements',
        method: 'GET',
        qs: {
            station_id: args.id,
            type: args.type,
            limit: args.limit,
            from: args.from,
            to: args.to,
            appid: 'weather appid'
        },
        json: true,
    };

    const measurements = await request(options);
    if (!measurements) {
        return null;
    }
    return measurements;
};
```

and add a resolver for the `weatherStation` query

```js
measurementsList: (_, args, ctx) => {
    return ctx.connectors.weatherStations.measurementsList(args);
}
```

Open the [playground](http://localhost:4000) again and send a query for `measurementsList`

```gql
{
  measurementsList(station_id: "weather station_id",
  type:"h",
  limit:100,
  from:1573039682000,
  to:1573041156900) {
    type
    date
    station_id
    temp {
      max
      min
      average
      weight
    }
  }
}
```

But that's more data than our clients need!

## Limits

Let's add some limiting to our queries so the clients can specify how many results they need.

Actually if you observe, in measurementsList `schema`, limit functionality is already implemented with input parameters `from` and `to`.

When you request with `from` and `to` dates/timestamp, measurementsList API will return all the measuremnts fall between this bucket.
